Below is a single, in-depth proposal for a small but unique and interesting game that does not require you to create any custom art. Everything can be done with minimal or even ASCII-based graphics, so you can focus purely on coding, logic, and gameplay. I’ll outline the concept, potential mechanics, and a step-by-step plan for how to implement it. At the end, you’ll find suggestions for expansion if you’d like to increase its complexity. All of this can be done offline, stored in a single GitHub repository, and built with tools you’re already comfortable using (like Python, JavaScript, etc.). The goal is to give you something small and manageable but still innovative enough to stand out.

Game Concept: “Temporal Maze: A Time-Traveling Puzzle Adventure”
Summary
Temporal Maze is a puzzle game set on a grid (or series of tile-based rooms) where the player can move around as a character in a minimal, top-down environment that only uses ASCII or basic tiles (no custom art required). The twist is that you can create “time clones” of yourself by jumping back in time. These clones replicate your past movements, allowing you to solve puzzles that require multiple simultaneous actions—like stepping on two switches at once or distracting roaming guards while you move elsewhere. The entire world state (like which doors are open or closed) can be influenced both by your real-time movement and by your “clones” created from time travel.

The aesthetic can be purely text-based—like old-school roguelike movement—or you can use placeholders, like colored squares or symbols, for walls, floors, your character, locked doors, etc. The complexity comes from designing time-manipulation puzzles, not from designing or drawing sophisticated graphics.

Why This Game Is Interesting (and Unique)
Time-Travel Mechanic:

Many puzzle games don’t incorporate multi-timeline logic. This one stands out because you can spawn clones that mimic your past moves.

You must carefully plan your actions in order to solve multi-step puzzles or press multiple pressure plates simultaneously.

No Artwork Needed:

The entire game can run in a terminal or a simple 2D grid. Walls can be represented by #, doors by +, the player by @, etc.

This means you can focus on coding puzzle logic, time rewinding, and game state management instead of pixel art or sprite design.

Expandable:

The base mechanic (time-travel clones) can easily be extended. Add puzzles with levers, unlocking door sequences, patrolling enemies, or pushable boxes that clones can interact with.

You can keep the final product as small or large as you want.

Great Programming Practice:

You’ll learn about storing world states, replaying movement data, detecting collisions, and orchestrating parallel “entities” that follow your previous actions.

Handling time travel will require some problem-solving around how to store game states or record the player’s moves in an efficient manner.

Detailed Game Flow
Movement and Grid Layout:

The game world is a 2D grid (like a chessboard). Each cell can be something like floor, wall, door, switch, or a special puzzle object.

The player moves with up/down/left/right keys (WASD or arrow keys), while each move costs one turn.

The user interface might be purely textual: you print the grid to the screen after each move, or you can do a small window with ASCII characters.

Time-Travel or “Record and Replay”:

At any time, the player can press a key (say “T”) to open a time-travel prompt.

They can choose to “rewind” to a specific number of steps in the past—maybe it’s just 5 turns back or 10 turns back.

Once they confirm, the game spawns a “time clone” that starts repeating exactly what the player did during those original steps.

Meanwhile, the player remains at the present position, free to move independently.

This allows for orchestrating scenarios where your clone stands on a switch to open a door while your “present” self passes through it.

Puzzle Elements:

Switches/Pressure Plates: Some puzzles require you or a clone to stand on a switch to keep a door open. Without the clone’s help, you can’t get through.

Doors: Represent locked paths that open only when certain conditions are met (e.g., a switch is held down).

Patrolling Guards (optional advanced feature): The guard might have a set path; a clone can distract or block the guard while you sneak by.

Pushable Crates: You can push crates onto switches or into certain areas. Clones can also replicate your movements to push crates in parallel.

Constraints and Limitations (for game balance):

Possibly limit the number of clones you can spawn to 1 or 2.

Each clone continues its replay until it reaches the “end” of that recorded segment. Once done, it disappears (or it stands still at its final location, depending on your design).

Time rewinding could cost a resource (e.g., a battery meter). This ensures you can’t spam clones infinitely.

Goal:

Usually, the level is solved by reaching an exit door, or collecting a key that’s in a locked area.

You create time clones strategically to open locked gates, distract hazards, or hold down multiple switches.

You can chain multiple puzzle rooms into a short “campaign” or just have a single, well-designed puzzle room for a small showcase.

Technical Outline & Implementation Steps
Below is a breakdown of how to approach building Temporal Maze in a straightforward manner. You can adapt the exact tech stack to your favorite programming environment.

1. Project Initialization
Language: Python is a popular choice for rapid prototyping, especially text-based. Alternatively, JavaScript with a minimal HTML/Canvas, or C++ with a library like ncurses for a terminal-based approach.

Repository Setup:

Create a new GitHub repo named “TemporalMaze” (or any name you prefer).

Initialize a basic folder structure:

css
Copy
TemporalMaze/
  src/
    main.py (or index.js, etc.)
    game_logic/
      world.py
      player.py
      time_travel.py
      ...
  maps/
    level1.txt
    level2.txt
  tests/
    test_world.py
    ...
  README.md
2. Grid and World Representation
Tile Types:

'#' (wall), '.' (floor), 'S' (switch), 'D' (door), '@' (player), etc.

Loading a Level:

A simple text file can define your map layout. Each line in the file corresponds to a row in the grid.

Parse that file to build a 2D list (e.g., world_map[y][x]) in memory.

3. Player and Movement
Position & State:

Keep track of (player_x, player_y), plus a small state machine if needed (e.g., is the player alive, did they exit the level?).

Movement Input:

Press up/down/left/right to move. Before the move is finalized, check collision with walls or locked doors.

If it’s a valid floor/switch tile, you move and update your position accordingly.

Game Loop (for text-based):

Each iteration:

Read input from the user.

Process movement or time-travel.

Update states (doors might open if a switch is pressed).

Render the new state of the world in text.

4. Time-Travel / Cloning Logic
Recording Past Moves:

Each turn, store the player’s position (and possibly other relevant state changes) in a list—like history = [(x0, y0), (x1, y1), ...].

You only need to keep up to some maximum length of history (like 50 steps).

Initiating Time Travel:

When the user presses “T,” ask how many turns back they want to go.

Suppose they choose 10. You then create a “clone entity” whose movement script is the recorded positions from history[-10] to history[-1].

Clone Entity:

Has its own position, updated each turn to the next recorded move in the sequence.

If you bumped into a wall in the past, the clone should replicate that “no movement” turn as well.

If you want the environment to be slightly different in the present (e.g., a door is now open that was previously closed), the clone’s movement might lead to new outcomes, or you can simply have the clone follow the same path ignoring new obstacles—this is a design decision.

Tracking Switches:

If a clone stands on a switch, that switch is considered “active,” same as if the real player is there.

5. Door and Switch Mechanics
Switch Tiles:

Marked as 'S' in the map. If the real player or a clone stands on it, the switch is pressed.

Door Tiles:

Marked as 'D' in the map. Typically, you can define them as locked.

They open if the relevant switch is pressed.

On opening, you might turn the door tile into a floor tile '.' temporarily, or keep a special door state (like 'D' is open vs 'D' is closed).

Multiple Switches:

You can code in that certain doors require multiple switches to be pressed at once, showcasing the puzzle aspect with time clones.

6. Rendering & User Interface
ASCII/Text Rendering:

Each turn, iterate through the 2D array. For each tile, print its corresponding character. For the player and clones, overwrite that position with their symbol ('@' for player, '*' for clones).

You can color-code text using ANSI escape codes in Python or a library that handles terminal colors (optional).

Minimal Graphical Window (Optional):

If you want a small 2D tile-based window, use something like Pygame or a JavaScript/HTML canvas. The “art” can still be simple placeholders—solid colored blocks for walls, a single rectangle for the player, etc.

7. Level Design and Testing
Prototype a Single Puzzle:

A small grid with one door, one switch, and a requirement that you can’t possibly hold down the switch and walk through the door alone. You must spawn a clone to hold the switch.

Expand to Multiple Levels:

Add more complex puzzles, multiple switches/doors, or patrolling enemies.

Challenge the player to use multiple clones in sequence.

8. Polish and Extras
Saving / Loading:

Let the user save game progress to a local file so they can return to a puzzle later.

Multiple Clones:

Maybe the user can spawn up to 2 or 3 clones, allowing for more intricate multi-step puzzle solutions.

Enemy AI:

A guard that moves along a preset path each turn. If the guard sees the player or a clone, puzzle fails (or you get “caught”).

Limited Rewinds:

Introduce a puzzle challenge: you only have 3 rewinds for the entire level. Plan carefully!

9. Documentation & GitHub Presentation
README.md:

Show sample screenshots (even if it’s ASCII) of how a puzzle looks.

Explain the key mechanic—time rewinding and clone creation.

Provide instructions on how to compile/run (if needed) or just how to launch main.py.

Code Comments and Architecture:

Keep your code logically separated: a “Game” class for handling overall logic, a “World” class for the map, a “Player/Clone” class for movement, etc.

Show that you’ve considered how to store states for time travel (like a history list).

Tests:

You can do basic unit tests: e.g., test that a door opens when a switch is pressed, test that time travel successfully spawns a clone, test collision with walls, etc.

Short Video/GIF (optional):

If you can, record a 15-second capture of the gameplay to embed in your repo’s README. ASCII-based games look surprisingly charming in animated GIFs.

Potential Variations and Expansion
Procedural Generation:

Instead of hand-designing each level, you could randomly generate rooms or labyrinths. This can showcase your algorithmic skills in generating solvable puzzles.

You’d still rely on the time-travel mechanic for certain puzzle-like sections in these random dungeons.

Portal/Teleportation Elements:

Combine time travel with “portals” that clones can operate to open shortcuts for the main player.

This intensifies the puzzle complexity without needing new visuals.

Stealth Mechanics:

If you add guards, you can create a short stealth puzzle. Clones might distract guards while you slip by.

This can be done with a minimal line-of-sight algorithm for each guard.

Item Collection:

Puzzles that require collecting keys in a certain sequence, or placing items on the ground for clones to pick up.

Each item can be textually represented (like 'k' for a key, 'p' for a potion, etc.).

Narrative and Dialogue:

If you want some flavor, add short text-based dialogues or “terminals” that give hints about how to solve puzzles.

This can flesh out a mini-story about exploring a time-distorted facility.

Conclusion & Final Thoughts
With Temporal Maze, you get a project that’s:

Intriguing: The time-travel/clone mechanic is immediately recognizable as unique, making for captivating puzzles.

Art-Free: You can go entirely ASCII or simple placeholders, focusing purely on logic, code structure, and puzzle design.

Expandable: You can start small—just one or two puzzle rooms—and add complexity over time.

Portfolio-Ready: It’s a self-contained project that demonstrates problem-solving, game loop architecture, user interaction, collision detection, and a novel mechanic.

Key Selling Points in your GitHub repo:

Well-commented code that highlights your approach to storing and rewinding game states.

A thorough README that explains the premise, mechanics, and how to play.

Possibly some tests or a short demo video that shows your ASCII world in action.

This design provides plenty of room to shine without requiring you to be an artist or incorporate external libraries for fancy visuals. You’ll create everything from scratch, offline, and you’ll walk away with a small, polished game that feels original. Whether you keep it at a single puzzle or evolve it into a multi-level puzzle “campaign,” you’ll have a standout project that’s fun, unique, and 100% your own.
